🎄 The Krampuz

The Krampuz is a short 2D horror-adventure game made for GameSanta Jam 2025.

You play as a kid who’s been on the Naughty List all year… until Santa gives her one last chance to redeem herself. Complete tasks around the house before time runs out — but be careful.
Krampuz, Santa’s evil twin, is lurking in the shadows. Once she finds you, there’s no escape.
